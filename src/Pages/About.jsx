            Hi all! My name is Nic Babineaux, I am currently located in Lafayette, Louisiana.
          I am a fullstack developer, aspiring musician, and powersports mechanic.< br/>
          Attended and graduated MMI mechanical school in Phoenix, Arizona class of 2010.
          Then went on to study Sociology/Social Psychology at South Louisiana Community College 2010-2012.< br />
          Bored with standard educational practices, I decided to travel the country and made lifetime memories along the way. 
          Post travels I returned to my mechanical career path. Ended up in Denver, Colorado where I made some of the best friends and memories of my life.< br />
          Returning to south Louisiana some years later...still in the powersports industry, I was on the search for something bigger, better, and more rewarding. 
          I got into cryptocurrencies and day trading. Furthermore, that led to an extreme interest in web design and software development.< br/>
          I enrolled in the Fullstack Academy of software and graduated in 2021 and never looked back. 
          Actively operating as a freelance front end and fullstack developer, creating responsive and functional web applications for individual artists and local small businesses!
