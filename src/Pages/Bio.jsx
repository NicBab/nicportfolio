            Hi all! My name is Nic Babineaux, I am currently located in Lafayette, Louisiana.
I am a fullstack developer, aspiring musician, and powersports mechanic.
Attended and graduated MMI mechanical school in Phoenix, Arizona class of 2010.
Then went on to study Sociology/Social Psychology at South Louisiana Community College 2010-2012. Bored with standard educational practices, I decided to travel the country and made lifetime memories along the way. Post travels I returned to my mechanical career path. Ended up in Denver, Colorado where I made some of the best friends and memories of my life. Returning to south Louisiana some years later...still in the powersports industry, I was on the search for something bigger, better, and more rewarding. I got into cryptocurrencies and day trading. Furthermore, that led to an extreme interest in web design and software development, which brings me to my current position today!
